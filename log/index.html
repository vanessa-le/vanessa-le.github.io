      Experiment 2: <i>Proposed Structure For My Day/Probably Won't Do Any Of This </i>
      <br><br>Date: April 2020
      <br>Size: 76 x 188 mm 
      <br><br>
       A bookmark with two versions of a written outline for a "productive" day, one is specific and pragmatic, whilst the other is more nonchalant and vague. Inspired by wall texts seen in the Centre Pompidou which contain French text and an English translation, the layouts vary between exhibitions but establish one language as dominant and the other as supportive.

      'I tell my students one of the most important things they need to know is when they are at their best, creatively. They need to ask themselves, What does the ideal room look like? Is there music? Is there silence? Is there chaos outside or is there serenity outside? What do I need in order to release my imagination?' <a href="https://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2008/09/toni-morrison.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[source]</a>

      This was an experiment in translating speech to a tangible form.

      Scanners usually don’t capture an image as a whole like a camera does, it (at least the one I have at home) has an "arm" that scans a section at a time. I wanted to work with and against the scanner to create a medium specific outcome.

      Experiment 6: 
     <i>Thinking about, how?</i>
    <br><br>Date: May 2020
    <br>Size: 140 x 180 mm
    <br><br>
    This poster draws parallels between concepts of brutalist architecture, skateboarding and my inability to clearly communicate the value of design. The quote is from a video clip of skateboarder Rodney Mullen, in which he discusses how he goes about sharing insights from his community to "outsiders" in his public speaking.

      This poster was based around the circle as a motif for my work. The frame within frame, layered imagery to the reflexive and cyclical nature of my approach to designing.

      <i>A Book of Sorts</i> for 'Unconventional Publishing'
      <br><br>Date: June 2020
      <br>Size: 76 x 188 mm 
      <br><br>
          This "book" contains a meandering string of connections between various "things", ranging from memories from before lockdown, to udon noodles, to a Spotify playlist for and about the book. 
      <br><br>
          One of the aims of this brief was to create a publication that was self-reflexive. That is a book that refers to itself and its making.

      Experiment 10: <i>Be Human</i>
     <br><br>Date: September 2020
     <br>Size: 210 x 283 mm
      <br><br>
     This experiment intertwines knowledge from the various fields and activities that I've drawn from in order to inform my design practice. Through utilising the footnotes as an instrument for narration I draw commonalities between these different ways of knowing in hopes of understanding:
      <br> <br>
      Why do I design things? <br> What makes design "good"? <br> How can design be a meaningful part of my life and the World? 
      <br> <br>
      It was presented as a part of an online exhibition at PIPES, you can have a look at it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFRKYi4hiyP/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
