      What is an "Experiment-logue"?
     <br><br>
     <br><br>
      It is an archive of design experiments and projects from my honours year. The name <i>experiment-logue</i> came from Donald Schön's theory of the designer as a reflective practitioner who converses with a 'situation', in order to make sense of complex ideas and problems.
      <br><br>  
      Cataloging these projects and documenting their processes was a core part of my research, because through observing and reflecting upon the different stages of making (before, during and after), I identified recurring themes and motifs in my work. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Through these experiments I explored the idea of the design process as a conversational process, in that the works produced are the result of multiple "voices" coming together. The ideas for these experiments form through the meeting of things I read or see and people that I talk with, even how I might be feeling in a particular moment.
